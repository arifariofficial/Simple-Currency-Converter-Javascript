<h2>Adding a new property to objects in an array</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p>In JavaScript, you have an array of objects </p><pre><code class="language-js">let arr = [{name: 'Joe', age: 25}, {name: 'Moe', age: 30}, {name: 'Doe', age: 35}];</code></pre> How can you use an object iterator and the `map()` method to create a new array of objects where each object has an additional property 'olderAge' that is 5 years more than the 'age' property of the original objects?
